LOS describes operating conditions on a scale of A to F, with “A” describing free flow, and “F” describing bumper-to-bumper conditions.\nExplore a dynamic map of our congestion management data. Reliability A new metric for measuring roadway reliability is introduced in this CMP update called the Buffer Time Index (BTI) This is calculated as the amount of extra travel time (expressed as a percent of average travel time) that the travelers need to additionally budget so that they have a 95% chance of arriving on time Like auto speed, reliability has improved significantly from 2019 to 2021 Note that a lower value of BTI indicates higher reliability ","link":"https://sfcta.github.io/cmpreport/docs/auto/","title":"Auto"},{"body":"Speed Compared to 2019, the average transit speed (collected for buses only) in 2021 increased 15% in the AM Peak and 24% in the PM Peak Like roadway speeds, most of the increase in transit speeds may be attributable to overall lower levels of demand Improved transit speeds may be attributable also to increased deployment of transit priority lanes, and to less delay resulting from fewer boardings and alightings, during COVID-19 Reliability Transit travel time reliability is measured in terms of transit speed variability as the coefficient of variation (CV) Reliability has worsened (variability has increased) since 2019 despite improvements in average transit speed While transit was slightly less reliable in 2021, the overall improvements in transit speeds far offset this effect Auto-Transit Speed Ratio The ratio of auto to transit speeds is calculated to assess the competitiveness of transit with driving A ratio of 2 would indicate that, for a particular segment, on-board transit travel time is twice that of auto travel time The average auto-transit speed ratio increased between 2019 and 2021 Both average auto and transit speeds improved this year but auto speeds improved more than transit speeds which resulted in transit being less competitive relative to auto ","link":"https://sfcta.github.io/cmpreport/docs/transit/","title":"Transit"},{"body":"Volume SFCTA collects multimodal counts at key locations Between 2019 and 2021, bicycle counts reduced significantly by about 30% and 50% during AM and PM peaks respectively Between 2019 and 2021, pedestrain counts reduced by about 70% across AM and PM peaks periods Safety Safety for pedestrians and cyclists are key measures of non-motorized transportation performance, and a critical policy priority for the city of San Francisco The City and County of San Francisco adopted Vision Zero as a policy in 2014, committing to build better and safer streets, educate the public on traffic safety, enforce traffic laws, and adopt policy changes that save lives While pedestrian fatalities decreased between 2019 and 2020, there was an increase in bicycle fatalities in the same period Overall, the total non-motorized fatalities were lower in 2020 than 2018 and 2019 Explore a dynamic map of bicycle and pedestrian safety data.

As required by state law, we develop and adopt a Congestion Management Program to monitor activity on our transportation network and adopt plans for mitigating traffic congestion in the city. Our Congestion Management work also aids in the development of the San Francisco Transportation Plan and provides input to San Francisco’s priorities for Plan Bay Area every four years.\nEvery two years, we release a report to update San Francisco’s Congestion Management Program. This report analyzes the performance of our transportation network, including transit, cars, bicycles, and pedestrians.\nGo to Online Performance Metrics\n","link":"https://sfcta.github.io/cmpreport/","title":"SF-CMP"}]

As required by state law, we develop and adopt a Congestion Management Program to monitor activity on our transportation network and adopt plans for mitigating traffic congestion in the city. Our Congestion Management work also aids in the development of the San Francisco Transportation Plan and provides input to San Francisco’s priorities for Plan Bay Area every four years.\nEvery two years, we release a report to update San Francisco’s Congestion Management Program. This report analyzes the performance of our transportation network, including transit, cars, bicycles, and pedestrians.\nGo to Online Performance Metrics\n","link":"https://sfcta.github.io/cmpreport/","title":"SF-CMP"},{"body":"","link":"https://sfcta.github.io/cmpreport/tags/","title":"Tags"}]

Welcome to the online version of San Fracisco CMP reports.

The Transportation Authority is the Congestion Management Agency for San Francisco. As required by state law, we develop and adopt a [Congestion Management Program](https://www.sfcta.org/projects/congestion-management-program) to monitor activity on our transportation network and adopt plans for mitigating traffic congestion in the city. Our Congestion Management work also aids in the development of the [San Francisco Transportation Plan](https://www.sfcta.org/projects/san-francisco-transportation-plan) and provides input to San Francisco’s priorities for [Plan Bay Area](https://www.sfcta.org/funding/plan-bay-area-2050) every four years.

Every two years, we release a report to update San Francisco’s Congestion Management Program. This report analyzes the performance of our transportation network, including transit, cars, bicycles, and pedestrians.
